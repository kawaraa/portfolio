              <h2>About me</h2>
              <p>
                I used to be an electronic engineer, but after 10 years of working in fixing smartphones I
                realized that I have big passion for Coding and Programing. so I looked for a school to study
                computer, and while I was in event for google on how to become a programmer, I met someone who
                suggested school to me called HackYourFuture. it's a coding school, this school changed my
                life path, I didn't just become a programmer I even changed the way I think. learning how to
                code never been easy, but the motivation and passion I have for programming, made me a code
                lover. yes I have always worked hard to gain as much experience as I can in this career. I
                love this aspect and I enjoy Working on both back-end as well as front-end development areas.
                I love building projects from start to finish for clients all over the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm available for remote work, if you would like to build something together or you have any
                question, feel free to <a href="#contact" class="link">get in touch</a>

                <h3>Speed Performance</h3>
                <p>
                  Fast load times and lag free interaction is one of my highest priorities. We know that the
                  application becomes slow as much as the it gets complex, here where speed performance comes
                  to play.

                <h3>Responsive</h3>
                <p>
                  Layouts work on any device, big or small. making your application working and looking good
                  on all devices is something essential nowadays.

                <p>
                  Websites don't have to be static, I love making applications come to life and making them
                  more functional
