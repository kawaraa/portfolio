                computer, and while I was in event for google on how to become a programmer, I met someone who
                suggested school to me called HackYourFuture. it's a coding school, this school changed my
                life path, I didn't just become a programmer I even changed the way I think. learning how to
                code never been easy, but the motivation and passion I have for programming, made me a code
                lover. yes I have always worked hard to gain as much experience as I can in this career. I
